# üñºÔ∏è LLM Image Filter Extension

**An intelligent Chrome extension that automatically detects, tags, and filters AI-generated and stylistic images on Twitter/X**

This extension uses AI models to automatically analyze and classify images in real-time as you browse Twitter/X.

Server API codebase can be found at https://github.com/0xkrauser/smart-filter-api

## How It Works üîß <a name="how-it-works"></a>

1. **Image Detection**: The extension scans Twitter/X posts for images in real-time
2. **Data Conversion**: Images are converted to base64 format using optimized canvas processing
3. **AI Classification**: Images are sent to a smart filter API for analysis
4. **Tagging**: Results are tagged and stored locally for future reference
5. **Content Filtering**: Posts with certain tags are automatically blurred/collapsed
6. **User Control**: Users can click to reveal any filtered content

### Key Components
